From the age of 12, I've been messing around on stage, playing pattern games (unwittingly, at the time) with friends. Even now, nearly 2 decades on, I'm still doing it; I've been taking Improv classes for a little over 2 years now and performing with troups and in festivals for the past year and it's all about spotting an developing patterns to comedic effect.\n\nThe same is true of my study of Physics. I took that course for the sole reason that I just love the subject. Physics is all about spotting patterns and developing models. I still recall the moment when I realised that 90% of Physics is basically waves, such that the equations that describe light passing through glass also explain why wine cellars stay at a constant temperature. Life got a whole lot easier when I figured that out.\n\nIn all, I love anything that is about finding hidden patterns and underlying, fundamental models that describe seemingly disparate phenomena. It's why I love improv, it's why I love crosswords and it's why I love software development.",
